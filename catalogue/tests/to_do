Models

test anything that is part of our design or that is defined by code that we have written,
but not libraries/code that is already tested by Django or the Python development team

- Team
- Supplier                                DONE
- ProductType
- Temperature
- Storage
- ProductInstance
- Order
- Requisition

Forms

you should test that the forms have the fields that you want,
and that these are displayed with appropriate labels and help text

- UpdateProductInstanceStockForm         DONE
- OrderForm

Views

generic class-based editing views do not need to be tested by the user as they are
procedurally generated by Django

- index
- productinstance_stock_update
- OrdersCreatedByUserListView ((perhaps - due to get_queryset method)
- OrderCreate (perhaps - due to form_valid method)
- SupplierListView          DONE
