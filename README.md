# EROS POD (Product Ordering Database)

A Django application developed to manage and keep track of current stock, product orders,  and requisitions at Bristol Genetics Laboratory. This was developed as part of the Clinical Scientist (Bioinformatics Genomics) HCPC Registration portfolio, module "Computing for Clinical Scientists (SBI101)"

## Author
- **Andrew Smith**

Development start date: 1st February 2019

Available at: https://github.com/Fyodir/POD

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.6.x)
- Modules
  - Django (2.1.5)


## User Administration
Before a prospective user can interact with the POD system they will require an authorised account to access any other page apart from the application home page. Therefore users must first be created before data can be be entered or viewed through the HTML browser.

### User creation
Staff must contact an individual with administrator rights to the POD system. This will typically be the developer or the one responsible for maintenance of the system.

### Forgotten Passwords
If a user has forgotten their password to the system they must contact the individual with administrator rights. The administrator will then be able to reset the password of the user in question

>*n.b. currently no function exists to email the user with a link to reset their password*

## Home page
This page is set up to display a collection of potentially useful information for the user. Among containing the title and application description a number of useful statistics are displayed.

These statistics include general numbers of Products and Suppliers contained within the application, and numbers to highlight orders at key stages of requisition or any that contain certain flags.

Counters for "Order Statistics" are designed to display colours to highlight the presence of orders within these counters

- ```BLUE``` - "Unsent Requisitions" and "Created Orders"
  - Number of orders/Requisitions that have been created but not yet submitted on the EROS ordering system
- ```YELLOW``` - "Awaiting Orders"
  - Number of orders that are submitted and out for order
- ```RED``` - "Part-Received Orders" and "Order Issues"
  - Number of orders that have either been part-received or currently have issues pertaining them (more detail can be found on specific order page)


**Note**
"Order Statistics" counters show ```BLACK``` if their counts are ZERO

## Differences between Product Types & Product Instances
**Product Type**
contains the meta data concerning a specific product. This includes details such as:
- Product Name
- Suppliers
- Product EROS
- Price (Â£)
- Lead Time Days)

*it does NOT contain information regarding the existence of a product within the laboratory*

**Product Instance**
contains information regarding the physical existence of a product within the laboratory. "Product Instance" pulls data from "Product Type", however adds extra data to link an "instance" of this product type with a laboratory team/location.
Extra data included in product Instance include:
- Associated Team
- Associated Storage Location
- Instance ID
- Date updated
- Current stock
- Minimum Stock

*n.b. Multiple "product instances" of the same "product type" can exist at any one time.*

## Create Requisition
A requisition is used to group together multiple orders. A Requisition with a current status of "To Order" is required to create orders. Once Requisition status is changed to "Sent", orders can no longer be attached to the requisition.

## Create Order
It must be reminded that a ```Requisition``` with a status of "To Order" must be present before a new order can be made. If this is not the case, please refer to ```Create Requisition``` before carrying on with this section. This is because ONLY requisitions with a status of "To Order" will be displayed to add an order to on the ```Create Order``` screen. Requisitions that have been sent can no longer be added to.
